Redis is an open-source, advanced key-value data store. It is also referred as a data structure server which keys not only contains strings, but also hashes, sets, lists, and sorted sets. Redis mostly used for cache solutions and session management. In this article, I record down some of the important points about Redis for the further review.

# Basic Features

Following are the main features of Redis:

- What is Redis: "Redis" stands for "REmote DIctionary Server", and it is written in ANSI C. It is extremely fast, persistent, portable and supports many languages such as C++, Java, PHP, etc. 
- The data structures: The data structures it supports include **string**, **list**, **hash**, **set** and **sorted set**.
- Redis is very fast: It is an in-memory key-value data store that can execute **10,0000** queries per second. Redis is very fast because it loads the whole dataset in primary memory.
- Replication feature: Redis supports simple master to slave replication. When a relationship is established, data from the master is transferred to the slave.
- The main limitation for Redis: is the size of the physical memory. therefore, it can't be used for data storing and searching at a very large scale.
