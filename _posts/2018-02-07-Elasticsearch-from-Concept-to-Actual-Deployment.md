In a project in recent months, I was responsible for investigating `Elasticsearch` and constructing a cluster for a product retrieval system. At this moment, the project is almost complete. So I record some of the key technical points for review. In this article, I will briefly introduce some of the basic concepts, the high availability mechanism of Elasticsearch, and then I will talk about some of the problems in actual cluster deployment.  

This article is entirely technical, anything related to commercial information has been excluded.
